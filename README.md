# EDDI Russian personality

Russian personality created for open source project [EDDI](https://github.com/EDCD/EDDI).

EDDI is a companion application for Elite: Dangerous, providing responses to events that occur in-game using data from the game as well as various third-party tools.

EDDI uses a text-to-speech engine, so for phrases to be pronounced correctly, a new EDDI personality must be created and translated into the desired language.

This project aims to translate and maintain EDDI's personality for Russian and complete immersion in the atmosphere of the game with a voice assistant.
